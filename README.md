# Pygame_Galaga
This project was assigned to me and my classmate in our Structure of Programming Languages class in order to give us a proper grip on object-oriented Python programming. It is a game that is supposed to vaguely resemble Galaga.
## How to Run:
- Download the game into a Python-compatible DE.
- Run the main.py file.
- Use w and s keys to move up and down and use the spacebar to shoot (You can hold all of these down if you choose).
## Collaborator:
- Jason Truskowski
